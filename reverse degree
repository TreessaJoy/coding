Given a string s, calculate its reverse degree.
The reverse degree is calculated as follows:
For each character, multiply its position in the reversed alphabet ('a' = 26, 'b' = 25, ..., 'z' = 1) with its position in the string (1-indexed).
Sum these products for all characters in the string.
Return the reverse degree of s. 






class Solution:
    def reverseDegree(self, s: str) -> int:
        total=0
        for i,ch in enumerate(s,start=1):
            total+=(123-ord(ch))*i
        return total
